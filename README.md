# Infinity-Scroll
Using Unsplash API we get pictures; by current setting random pictures of regular quality.
Those pictures are then added to the page by DOM manipulation, 5 on first page load, then 30 each time user scrolls close to bottom.

There is also a custom load animation, which only shows during the first page load.

# Potential update to do
By checking Unsplash API documentation, can identify further options to get specific types of pictures as needed.
